I'm a data analyst living in Victoria, Australia. As an econometrics/stats enthusiast, I continue learning and crunching data in my spare times, hoping to gain a bit of insight that is worth sharing. I was majored in finance in Uni, so the stuff I write will lean slightly towards economics and financial analysis.

If you like to get in touch, here is my [LinkedIn](https://au.linkedin.com/pub/chad-meng/99/417/501) page.

Here is my Github account: [The Link](https://github.com/cy-meng). In there you should be able to find the scripts and raw datasets I use in my posts.
